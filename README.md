### Building

Need to use at least Android Studio Arctic Fox to build/run the Android client. 

Requires Xcode 13.2 or later (due to use of new Swift 5.5 concurrency APIs). When opening iOS project remember to open `.xcworkspace` file (and not `.xcodeproj` one)

### Compose for Desktop client

This client is available in `compose-desktop` module. Note that you need to use appropriate version of JVM when running (works for example with Java 11)

Note that this makes use of https://github.com/Shusshu/android-flags for flag images shown.
